# Wedding Site - Next.js 
This is a minimal Next.js 14 app (app router) scaffold for the wedding site you described.
Replace the placeholder images in `/public` with your actual images (names already match those used in the code).

How to run:
1. Extract the zip.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- TailwindCSS is configured. You may want to run `npx tailwindcss -i ./app/globals.css -o ./styles/output.css --watch` only if customizing; the included setup uses Tailwind directly.
- The OG image is set to `/og.png` â€” replace `public/og.png`.
- Music file placeholder is `public/music.mp3`.
- The countdown targets **Oct 19, 2025 10:30 AM** local time.
